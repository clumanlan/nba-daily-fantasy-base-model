# NBA Daily Fantasy

## Introduction
Creating a winning NBA fantasy lineup requires both: (accurate) fantasy point predictions and a way to create a lineup that maximizes the chances of winning. 
For fantasy point predictions, we create both a Random Forest and Linear Regression that predicts fantasy points based on rolling lagged player and team stats. We use these fantasy point predictions in the optimization and also require the constraint that at least two correlated players are included in the lineup in order to increase variance thereby increasing the upper range of total expected fantasy points for the lineup.
